# Gohetia / Menezes — Midterm Assignment
This project was created for the Multimedia Authoring (MMED-1054) Midterm Exam, winter semester of 2024, taught by professor Marco de Luca. 

It's main objective is to create a HTML page with a discussion between the two students, containing both points of view — at the end, students are required to merge the branches of their work into a final file, without conflicts. 

### Students participating:
- Sheldon Gohetia
- Henrique Gamborgi Menezes

## Installation
1. Click on the link to the sample repository provided;
2. On the repo, click on the green button "< > Code";
3. On the last option, click on "Download zip";
4. Unzip the folder.

## Usage
1. Download the folder on your device;
2. Open the index.html file on your browser.

## Assignment History
**You will be building a 1-page app.** Pick a subject that you can disagree with - both points of view should appear in the final submission. As an example, one person could argue that dogs are best, the other person could argue that in fact cats are WAY better than dogs. 

Create a simple page with images and text. Divide the page into two sections; the first section is arguing FOR, the second is arguing AGAINST. Create a conflict with your teammate before you get too far into the assignment; resolve it. Create a Github repo with a ReadMe file; push the project and submit the link. 

#### Assignment Requirements 
A few paragraphs of text for each point of view and at least one image for each is required. One team member must create a repositoryon Github with a Readme. Add your partner as a collaborator. Put the appropriate information in the readme file (this will be basic, because it’s a simple 1-off). 

Each team member will create a branch and add their argument / position and image(s) to the app. Merge everything to the masterbranch when you’re finished. Do code reviews before you merge. Push the finished files to your repo, double check to make sure you’ve merged everything to the master branch and submit the repoURL to the FOL dropbox. 

#### Submission Requirements & Due Date
- Homework must be submitted by end of class in Week 7 
- Github repo: master branch, and a branch for each team member- Name the dev branches appropriately per member IE dev.yourinitials.argument 
- Submit the repo URL via FOL dropbox 
- DO NOT submit working files 
- Please follow correct folder and file structure as outlined in class. 

#### Grading Rubric

- (Valid HTML, Images and Text) /5 
- Folder Structure /1 
- GitHub Best Practices /10 
- Conflict and Resolution /4
- **TOTAL GRADING =20**
