        Hey, Sheldon! I have divided everything in rounds and started playing a bit with our page and CSS (which is not needed, so 
        I didn't go any further...) I have also written a few things already about our fight, including a bit of your character, 
        but it was just to map the fight out, I'd love if you take a read and contribute with your own words and "attacks".

        To be honest, after learning a bit about your character, I think we already have a winner: Gojo. But let's try to make 
        an effort to disagree lol

        Also, I added this cool images on the transitions of the round. Hope you like them! :)

        <h2 class="page-description">
          This project will show you an epic character showdown, where Sheldon
          and Henrique will engage in an intense debate regarding their favorite
          anime characters, discussing who is the strongest and most powerful.
          We will talk about our favorite characters backgrounds, worlds,
          strenghts, weaknesses and, most important of all:
          <span>fighting skills!</span>
        </h2>
        <h2 class="page-description">
          Like a mixed martial art bout, we will go through 3 rounds. Each round
          will display and test the chosen characters abilities: speed, strength
          and fight IQ. The character who has most rounds will win the decision
          at the end!

    <p>
      I am <b>Sheldon Gohetia</b>, and my favorite anime character is
      <b>Gojo</b>. He is a fictional character from the anime and manga series
      "Jujutsu Kaisen." He is a highly skilled and powerful sorcerer who serves
      as a teacher at Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical College.
    </p>

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
    <p>
      <b>Gojo</b> is stronger than <b>Monkey D. Luffy</b> because aside from
      Gojo can swim in any kind of water, he is also have exceptional combat
      abilities, he has the mastery of the so called "Infinity" technique, which
      grants him near invulnerability and incredible speed.

          <!-- In here, we descibre a bit about Luffy-->
          <p>
            And now, introducing in the red corner, coming from the vast seas
            and fresh from a legendary quest for the One Piece, we have the
            rubber and fearless pirate, Monkey D. Luffy! While a kid, Luffy ate
            a miracle devil fruit who gave him a rubber body and uncountable
            strength. He possesses several remarkable abilities that make him a
            force to be reckoned with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Obviously being made of rubber gives Luffy some special skills, such
            as dodging objects and attacks, moving extremely fast, turning his
            limbs giants and more. Luffy's resilience allow him to endure
            physical pain and injuries. This mental ability is a key aspect of
            his character, making him push beyond his limits in every bad
            situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, we can't forget to mention his biggest and probably only
            weakness: he can't go underwater. The fruit he ate gives him his
            power, but makes impossible for him to swim... <span>Henrique</span>

        <!-- This is the first round, I wrote some arguments but I believe Luffy takes this one...-->
        <p>
          <b>Gojo</b> is stronger than Luffy. Aside from the skill to swim in
          any kind of water, he also has exceptional combat abilities, he has
          mastered the so called "Infinity" technique, which grants him near
          invulnerability and incredible speed. <span>[Sheldon]</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Luffy</b> has powers that go way beyond than being made out of
          rubber — you wouldn't believe how much you can do with that! During
          his journey, he has developed incredible velocity, enough to make him
          look like a blur on the battlefield. Not only incredible speed,
          achieved by the "Observation Haki" technique, he can perceive any
          movement of his opponent or incoming attacks, making Luffy near
          untouchable. <span>[Henrique]</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>
            Gojo is pretty fast. But Luffy's Haki gives him the upper hand on
            this round.</b

        />
        <!-- This is the second round, about strength. After reading a bit, I think Gojo takes it -->
        <p>
          <b>Luffy's</b> strength is no joke, especially when he unleashes his
          Gear Third, transforming his arms and legs into gigantic, inflated
          weapons. His conquests against monsters and pirates on his world are
          impressive. However, he's not fighting anyone of his world.
          <span>[Henrique]</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Gojo</b>, on the other side, holds the power of cursed energy,
          capable of creating destructive magic fields and using techniques that
          can disintegrate his enemies. In addition, Gojo possesses a unique
          ability called the "Six Eyes" that grants him enhanced perception and
          the ability to see the flow of Cursed Energy in greater detail and
          make him untouchable. No matter how strong the opponent is, if it
          can't land a single blow on him, it's useless. <span>[Sheldon]</span>
          <!-- Write in here more arguments in favor of Gojo for the 2nd round, regarding strength and powers.-->

        <p>
          <b

        />
        <!-- For the 3rd round, it's about inteligente and fight IQ. Gojo definitely takes this one,right? -->
        <p>
          <b>Luffy</b> is not really known for his inteligence. However, he is a
          very creative and unpredictable opponent. He is always finding new
          ways to use his powers, adapting and learning a lot from every fight,
          to counter his enemies.
          <span>[Henrique]</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <!-- Write in here more arguments in favor of Gojo for the 3rd round, regarding fight IQ and inteligence.-->
          <b>Gojo</b>, as a paragon of intellectual powers, a strategic virtuoso
          whose mental acuity transcends conventional boundaries. His mind, akin
          to a labyrinthine fortress, effortlessly navigates the complexities of
          jujutsu techniques and tactics. Gifted with a prodigious understanding
          of Cursed Energy and its intricate nuances, Gojo's brilliance
          illuminates the darkest corners of mystic combat, gives him advantage
          in the fight IQ and inteligence area. <span>[Sheldon]</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >Gojo's inteligence is definitely one of his main weapons. Once
            again, he comes up on top.</b

        <!-- This is our final decision and winner announcement. I believe Gojo takes it 2 rounds against 1. -->
        <p>
          <!-- You can write more about the decision if you want! -->
          After three intense rounds, the winner is the last one standing!
          <b>Satoru Gojo</b> emerges as the victor, displaying superiority in
          strength, and fight IQ. His combination of cursed techniques,
          overwhelming cursed energy, and strategic brilliance proves to be too
          much for the rubber pirate. In our epic anime character showdown,
          Gojo's dominance in the Jujutsu Kaisen universe takes the belt home!
        </p>
        <p>
          As said before, one of <b>Luffy</b> most impressive skills is his
          endurance and ability to find new ways of fighting. Maybe after
          learning a bit more about Satoru Gojo and his fighting style, Luffy
          can come back stronger and ready for a proper rematch!
