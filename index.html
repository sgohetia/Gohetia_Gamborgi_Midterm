          This project will show you an epic character showdown, where Sheldon
          and Henrique will engage in an intense debate regarding their favorite
          anime characters, discussing who is the strongest and most powerful.
          We will talk about our favorite characters backgrounds, worlds,
          strenghts, weaknesses and, most important of all:
          <span>fighting skills!</span>
          <br/> <br/>
          Like a mixed martial art bout, we will go through 3 rounds. Each round
          will display and test the chosen characters abilities: speed, strength
          and fight IQ. The character who has most rounds will win the decision
          at the end!
          <br/> <br/>
          <span>Let's start introducing our anime heroes:</span>

            Introducing first, fighting out of the blue corner, emerging from a hidden world of sorcery, 
            the insanely powerful and skilled: Satoru Gojo! He serves as a teacher at Tokyo Metropolitan Curse
            Technical College, and possesses insanely strong magic.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a professor, Gojo trains his students to become Jujutsu sorcerers, capable of combating curses and supernatural 
            entities, that threatens the balance between worlds. His awkward teaching style, combined with his set of skills,
             makes him a strong and feared figure in his universe. <span>[Sheldon]</span>

          <h3 class="character">2. Monkey D. Luffy</h3>
          <h4 class="character-aux">from the anime One Piece</h4>
          <img id="luffy-profile"
            src="./images/luffy-profile.png"
            width="300px"

          />
          <h4 class="author">chosen by Henrique Gamborgi Menezes</h4>
          <p>
            And now, fighting out of the red corner, coming from the vast seas
            and fresh from a legendary quest for the One Piece, we have the
            rubber and fearless pirate: Monkey D. Luffy! While a kid, Luffy ate
            a miracle devil fruit who gave him a rubber body and uncountable
            strength. He possesses several remarkable abilities that make him a
            force to be reckoned with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Obviously being made of rubber gives Luffy some special skills, such
            as dodging objects and attacks, moving extremely fast, turning his
            limbs giants and more. Luffy's resilience allow him to endure
            physical pain and injuries. This mental ability is a key aspect of
            his character, making him push beyond his limits in every bad
            situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, we can't forget to mention his biggest and probably only
            weakness: he can't go underwater. The fruit he ate gives him his
            power, but makes impossible for him to swim. <span>[Henrique]</span>

        />
        <!-- This is the first round -->
        <p>
          <b>Gojo</b> is stronger than Luffy. Aside from the skill to swim in
          any kind of water, he also has exceptional combat abilities, he has
          mastered the so called "Infinity" technique, which grants him near
          invulnerability and incredible speed. <span>[Sheldon]</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Luffy</b> has powers that go way beyond than being made out of
          rubber — you wouldn't believe how much you can do with that! During
          his journey, he has developed incredible velocity, enough to make him
          look like a blur on the battlefield. Not only incredible speed,
          achieved by the "Observation Haki" technique, he can perceive any
          movement of his opponent or incoming attacks, making Luffy near
          untouchable. <span>[Henrique]</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>
            Gojo is pretty fast. But Luffy's Haki gives him the upper hand on
            this round.</b

        <h2 class="subtitle"><span>Round 2:</span>Strength</h2>
        <img

          width="900"
          height="300"
        />
        <!-- This is the second round  -->
        <p>
          <b>Luffy's</b> strength is no joke, especially when he unleashes his
          Gear Third, transforming his arms and legs into gigantic, inflated
          weapons. His conquests against monsters and pirates on his world are
          impressive. However, he's not fighting anyone of his world.
          <span>[Henrique]</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Gojo</b>, on the other side, holds the power of cursed energy,
          capable of creating destructive magic fields and using techniques that
          can disintegrate his enemies. In addition, Gojo possesses a unique
          ability called the "Six Eyes" that grants him enhanced perception and
          the ability to see the flow of Cursed Energy in greater detail,
          making him untouchable. No matter how strong the opponent is, if it
          can't land a single blow on him, it's useless. <span>[Sheldon]</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >In this battle of strength, Gojo's cursed energy and
            his Six Eyes technique tips the scales in his favor.</b>

          height="300"
        />
        <!-- This is the 3rd round -->
        <p>
          <b>Luffy</b> is not really known for his inteligence. However, he is a
          very creative and unpredictable opponent. He is always finding new
          ways to use his powers, adapting and learning a lot from every fight,
          to counter his enemies.
          <span>[Henrique]</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b>Gojo</b>, as a paragon of intellectual powers, a strategic virtuoso
          whose mental acuity transcends conventional boundaries. His mind, akin
          to a labyrinthine fortress, effortlessly navigates the complexities of
          jujutsu techniques and tactics. Gifted with a prodigious understanding
          of Cursed Energy and its intricate nuances, Gojo's brilliance
          illuminates the darkest corners of mystic combat, gives him advantage
          in the fight IQ and inteligence area. <span>[Sheldon]</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          <b
            >Gojo's inteligence is definitely one of his main weapons. Once
            again, he comes up on top.</b
