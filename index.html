    <p>
      I am <b>Sheldon Gohetia</b>, and my favorite anime character is
      <b>Gojo</b>. He is a fictional character from the anime and manga series
      "Jujutsu Kaisen." He is a highly skilled and powerful sorcerer who serves
      as a teacher at Tokyo Metropolitan Curse Technical College.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>Gojo</b> is stronger than <b>Monkey D. Luffy</b> because aside from
      Gojo can swim in any kind of water, he is also have exceptional combat
      abilities, he has the mastery of the so called "Infinity" technique, which
      grants him near invulnerability and incredible speed.
